# Penrose


The file `penrose.ml` contains the basic code to generate a Penrose tiling.
To launch the program, make sure you installed the `graphics` module then simply type `ocaml penrose.ml`.

The file `penrose_extended.ml` goes further by letting the user trigger the animation steps using the space key.
As above, make sure you installed the `graphics` module then type `ocaml penrose_extended.ml` to launch the program.

You may tweak the programs' parameters directly in the source files.
